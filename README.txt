Assembly CMS
============

This is the Assembly CMS. It was created to serve as a Web Content Management
for the Assembly (and related) websites during Assembly Summer 2009.

Goal and vision
---------------

The Assembly CMS is intended to be a CMS with a small and simple but flexible
core. It is intended to be able to serve different specialised purposes on a
single content model. The main goal are public web sites.

It is intended to:

- be easy to work with for smart but occasional users
- run multiple sites within a single server
- easily create and maintain custom public layouts
- easily create content extensions like workflow or multi-lingual content
- be easy to test

License note

The CMS core and the general extensions are licensed under ZPL 2.1. The skin
